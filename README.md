# Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project

## Background Context

Greetings and welcome to the AirBnB Clone project! Before diving into the coding journey, acquaint yourself with the AirBnB concept by reading the dedicated page.

## Project Overview

This project marks the inception of your AirBnB clone, guiding you through the creation of a fully functional web application. The primary focus of this initial phase is crafting a command interpreter—a crucial foundation for managing AirBnB objects throughout the development process. The acquired skills will seamlessly integrate into subsequent projects, including HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Key Objectives

1. **Parent Class (BaseModel):** Establish a parent class (BaseModel) for initiating, serializing, and deserializing future instances.

2. **Serialization Flow:** Develop a simple flow for serialization and deserialization, transitioning smoothly between Instance, Dictionary, JSON string, and file.

3. **Object Classes:** Create classes for essential AirBnB entities (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from the BaseModel.

4. **Storage Engine:** Introduce the project's first abstracted storage engine—File storage.

5. **Unit Testing:** Rigorously validate all classes and the storage engine through comprehensive unit tests.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without relying on Google:

- Creating a Python package
- Developing a command interpreter in Python using the cmd module
- Implementing Unit testing in a large project
- Serializing and deserializing a Class
- Writing and reading a JSON file
- Managing datetime
- Understanding UUID
- Utilizing *args and **kwargs
- Handling named arguments in a function
