# Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project

## Background Context

Greetings and welcome to the exciting world of the AirBnB Clone project! Before you embark on this coding journey, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the AirBnB concept by reading the dedicated page.

## Project Overview

This project marks the inception of your AirBnB clone—a step-by-step guide to building a fully functional web application. The primary objective of this initial phase is to craft a command interpreter, a crucial foundation for managing your AirBnB objects throughout the development process. The skills you acquire in this stage will seamlessly integrate into subsequent projects involving HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, and front-end integration.

## Key Objectives

1. **Parent Class (BaseModel):** Establish a parent class (BaseModel) responsible for the initiation, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.

2. **Serialization Flow:** Develop a simple flow for serialization and deserialization, allowing smooth transition between Instance, Dictionary, JSON string, and file.

3. **Object Classes:** Create classes for essential AirBnB entities (User, State, City, Place, etc.) that inherit from the BaseModel.

4. **Storage Engine:** Pave the way for the project's first abstracted storage engine—File storage.

5. **Unit Testing:** Rigorously validate all classes and the storage engine through comprehensive unit tests.

## What's a Command Interpreter?

Think of it as an AirBnB Shell—a versatile tool designed for a specific purpose. Your command interpreter allows you to:

- Create new objects, whether it's a User or a Place.
- Retrieve objects from various sources like files or databases.
- Perform operations on objects, such as counting or computing statistics.
- Update attributes of existing objects.
- Safely destroy objects when necessary.

## Get Started

Now that you have a clear roadmap, dive into the world of code and command interpretation. Remember, each task is a stepping stone, bringing you closer to the realization of your AirBnB clone. Happy coding!
